Projects from Data Bootcamp
Weekly Summaries
Week 1

In Week 1 the workbook introduced foundational concepts of data analytics and established the groundwork for the course project. The key activities and deliverables comprised:

An orientation to the data-technician role: responsibilities, typical workflows, and required skills (e.g., data cleaning, basic exploratory analysis).

Introduction to the dataset and project context: setting up the project repository, obtaining the retail sales dataset (or equivalent) and familiarising with the file and folder structure.

Initial data ingestion and overview: reading the dataset into a tool (e.g., Excel, or an analytics environment), checking data types, missing-values, and getting summary statistics.

Documentation of findings: generation of a short summary report / worksheet capturing insights such as data size, missing values, unique counts and potential issues for further cleaning.

Week 2

Week 2 built on the foundations and focused on deeper data cleaning and preparation. The key tasks included:

Handling missing data and outliers: identifying blank, null or out-of-range entries, and applying strategies to fill, remove or flag them.

Data formatting and transformation: converting date/time fields, categoricals, numeric encoding, and ensuring fields are appropriately typed and formatted for analysis.

Exploratory visualisations: producing initial charts (histograms, boxplots, frequency counts) to understand distributions, relationships and anomalies in the data.

Documenting the process: creating a record of cleaned-vs-raw counts, transformations applied, and preliminary remarks about data quality and next steps.

Week 4

In Week 4 the focus shifted towards analysis and deriving insights from the cleaned data. Activities included:

Aggregation & grouping: summarising data by key dimensions (for example by product, region, time period) to compute metrics such as total sales, average selling price, and volume.

Time-series or trend analysis: exploring how sales (or other key metrics) vary over time (daily/weekly/monthly), identifying seasonal patterns or growth/decline trends.

Cross-tabulation & segmentation: comparing performance across segments (e.g., store locations, product categories), identifying top/bottom performers.

Visual storytelling: building charts or dashboards (bar charts, line plots, heatmaps) to clearly communicate findings and highlight areas for deeper investigation.

Key insights & business implications: summarising what the patterns suggest for decision-making (e.g., growth opportunities, under-performing segments, seasonal peaks) and proposing next analytic steps or hypotheses.

Week 5

Week 5 consolidated the previous work and progressed towards more advanced insights, modelling or predictive thinking. Highlights included:

Advanced analysis or modelling preparation: for example regression, forecasting, or classification depending on the dataset context — the aim being to move beyond descriptive into predictive or explanatory analytics.

Validation and interpretation of results: ensuring that models (or advanced calculations) are validated—checking assumptions, residuals or error metrics; interpreting outputs in a business context.

Recommendation & action-plan development: crafting recommendations based on the analysis, defining potential business actions, and articulating risks/limitations of the findings.

Final documentation and presentation: compiling the project deliverables (cleaned data summary, analysis visuals, modelling results, recommendations) into a cohesive report or workbook ready for review.
