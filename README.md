## 📅 Day 1: Task 1 — Tableau Versions

### Objective
Research the different versions of Tableau and explain the limited functionality of **Tableau Public**.

### Findings
Tableau offers multiple versions that connect directly to a wide variety of data sources, including Salesforce, Microsoft SQL, AWS, and more.  
However, **Tableau Public** is limited in scope — it only allows access to **local data sources** such as spreadsheets, text files, or Tableau Data Extracts.  

This makes Tableau Public best suited for:
- Learning and portfolio building  
- Sharing visualisations publicly online  
- Non-confidential or open datasets  

It is **not suitable for secure business environments** or private data analysis.
