Day 1: Tableau Exploration and Dashboard Creation

Task 1: Researched Tableau Versions 

I researched and compared the different versions of Tableau.

I explained the limited functionality of Tableau Public, noting that it only allows access to local copies like spreadsheets, text files, or Tableau Data Extracts. Other versions allow direct connections to dozens of data sources, such as Salesforce, Microsoft SQL, and AWS.


Task 2: Created a Tableau Dashboard 

I used the EMSI_JobChange_UK dataset to create my own dashboard.

The dashboard included a bar chart showing percentage change and a UK-based map illustrating the key city locations impacted.

Day 2: Data Analysis and Trend Finding

Task 1: Analyzed the Spotify Dataset 

I conducted an analysis on the Spotify data set to find trends and key information.

Key Findings:

I found that the most popular artist is Drake (31,703), who is significantly ahead of the second-place artist.

I also found that the energy in a song does not correlate to popularity.

I noted that Tempo seems to have only a small input in popularity.


Task 2: Analyzed the Health Dataset and Reflected 

I conducted an analysis on the Health data set to find trends and key information.

I reflected on how this data could support decision-making for the NHS, knowing that data can be lifesaving and is being used more within the NHS.
