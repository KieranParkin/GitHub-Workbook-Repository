Statement of Achievement: Data Technician Workbook - Week 5

During Week 5, I focused entirely on developing my programming and data manipulation skills, successfully completing foundational tasks in Python and numerous practical exercises using the Pandas library for data analysis.

My key achievements for this week include:

Python Programming Fundamentals

Logical Programming (FizzBuzz): I successfully developed and tested a core Python program to solve the classic FizzBuzz problem. This task demonstrated my understanding of:


Iterating through a range (1 to 100) using a for loop.

Implementing complex conditional logic (if, elif, else).

Using the modulo operator (%) for checking divisibility by 3 and 5.

Data Analysis with Pandas
I completed an extensive set of group and individual exercises using the Pandas library, demonstrating mastery of the data workflow from ingestion to exportation.


Data Loading and Exploration (Exercise 1): I learned to ingest data by reading a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame and immediately performed crucial exploratory steps, including viewing the first 5 rows, checking the DataFrame's overall information and data types, and calculating basic summary statistics.



Indexing and Slicing (Exercise 2): I gained proficiency in selecting data, specifically writing code to select single and multiple columns (e.g., 'name' and 'mark') and using conditional filtering to select rows based on values (e.g., all rows where 'class' is 'Four').


Data Manipulation and Transformation (Exercise 3 & 5): I transformed and cleaned the data by:

Adding a new column ('passed') based on a logical condition (mark >= 60).

Renaming a column (from 'mark' to 'score') and dropping columns.


Creating a new categorical column ('grade') by applying complex criteria (e.g., marks >= 85 are 'A', 70-84 are 'B', etc.).

Aggregation and Reporting (Exercise 4 & 5): I performed key analytical tasks:

Used groupby() to calculate the mean mark for each class and the average mark for each gender.


Counted the number of students in each class.

Created an advanced pivot table using 'class' as rows and 'gender' as columns.

Sorted the final DataFrame by 'mark' in descending order.

Real-World Data Handling

Individual Practice (Day 4): I independently applied my core Pandas skills on the ‘GDP (nominal) per Capita’ dataset. This practice included reading the file into a DataFrame, inspecting the first 10 and last 5 rows, and selecting specific columns ('Country/Territory' and 'UN_Region').



Export and Collaboration: I completed the data pipeline by writing code to save the final transformed DataFrame (with the new 'grade' column) to a new CSV file. I also participated in group activities to further embed my Python skills by working through a dedicated notebook and exploring additional datasets.
