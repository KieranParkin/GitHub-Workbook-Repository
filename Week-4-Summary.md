Statement of Achievement: Data Technician Workbook - Week 4
During Week 4, I successfully completed all required research, practical Azure labs, and the final consultancy report preparation, demonstrating a strong understanding of Cloud Computing Concepts and UK Data Laws and Regulations.

My key achievements for this week include:

Cloud Computing and Architecture

Core Concepts: Researched and articulated the benefits of cloud computing for businesses (e.g., faster time to market, scalability) and explored alternative distributed architectures like Fog, Edge, and Mesh Computing.



Service Models: Defined, compared, and provided real-world use cases for the three main cloud service models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).



Deployment Models: Explained the four primary cloud deployment models (Public, Private, Hybrid, and Community Cloud) and identified appropriate use cases for each, such as using Private Cloud for highly regulated industries.


Data Laws and Compliance

Computer Misuse Act 1990: Defined and provided examples for the three major offences, including Unauthorised Access (Section 1) and Unauthorised Acts with Intent to Impair Operation (Section 3).


Legal Updates: Described the three extra powers introduced by the Police and Justice Act 2006, notably the explicit criminalisation of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and the offence of creating/supplying 'hacker tools'.


Data Protection: Identified the rules governing employer data storage, specifying which items (e.g., Name, National Insurance Number) can be stored without permission and which sensitive categories (e.g., Racial Origin, Health Data) require explicit employee consent, referencing UK government guidelines.


Intellectual Property: Distinguished between Copyright Infringement and Plagiarism with practical examples, and documented the severe consequences of software piracy, including criminal penalties, civil liability, and security risks from malware.


Regulatory Mapping: Successfully matched various legal clauses to the correct UK legislation, including the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA) and the Consumer Rights Act 2015.

Azure Data Services & Consultancy
Practical Labs (Azure): Completed and documented three Azure practical labs focusing on different data storage and analytics paradigms:

Lab 3: Explore Relational Data in Azure.


Lab 4: Explore Non-Relational Data in Azure.


Lab 5: Explore Data Analytics in Azure.


Consultancy Proposal: Prepared a comprehensive Azure consultancy proposal for "Paws & Whiskers," which involved:

Recommending specific Azure services for storage (Azure SQL Database, Azure Blob Storage), analysis (Azure Synapse Analytics), and integration (Azure Data Factory).

Outlining a data modelling approach for key data categories.

Mandating compliance with GDPR and the DPA 2018.

Incorporating essential technical considerations such as data storage formats (Parquet for analytics), data security (encryption and access controls), and a strategy for Backup and Disaster Recovery.
